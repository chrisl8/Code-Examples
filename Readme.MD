Code Examples
=============

This is a collection of bits of code that I find myself using over and over.
It saves me from digging through old repositories to find things I did before,
or from going back to Stack Overflow repeatedly for the same thing.

I add stuff here when I have to use it for the second or third time.

The goal is a brain dump, but also by documenting these here I can refine
them over time.

It also allows me to document the style I'm currently using,
and refine that style.

It also gives me a place to heavily document code in a "teaching" fashion,
so that I can be less wordy in the comments in my working projects.

Finally, by documenting each example line by line I learn about the code.
Many times I get to a bit of code and realize that I don't actually understand it,
which forces me to figure out out one way or another so that I can
document it or fix it.

Future Ideas:
* Some tests of the code (yeah, they should work, right?).
* A code style guideline and actually follow it
  * Maybe a way to check my code for compliance?
