### Examples and Tidbits ###
This is a repo for me to store code clippings and examples.

Sometimes I have a hard time remembering how to do basic things, so I will put them here to allow me to refresh my memory quickly.

This will also allow me to refine patterns over time and build a "best practice" example of more complex routines.
